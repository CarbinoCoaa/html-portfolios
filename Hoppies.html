<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing football with my friends and spending
 time with my family.  </p>
<p>I also like playing dominoes, which is a fun and social way to relax. </p>
<p>I value strong relationships and enjoy being around the people I care about. 
In addition, I’m always curious and open to learning new things, 
whether it’s a new skill, idea, or perspective.</p>
